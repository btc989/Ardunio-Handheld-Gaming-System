<p>Overview: <br>
  This project is to create a handheld gaming system using the Ardunio Uno. This program includes <br>
    ~ Menu Function <br>
    ~ Three games ( Snake, Pong, Tic-Tac-Toe) <br>
    ~ Bluetooth connection between Ardunios (comming soon...) </p>


<p>Hardware Used: <br>
  ~Arduino Uno <br>
  ~ Nokia 5110 LCD Screen <br>
  ~Joystick Shield V2.4 from ElecFreaks.com  <br>
  ~BlueTooth Module HC-05</p>

<p>Project Design:</p>

<p>~Screen HookUp: <br>
      8 pins are used for the LCD Screen. The following decribes the hookup: <br>
       -VCC = 3.3 Volts ****PLEASE NOTE ANYMORE THEN 3.3 VOLTS WILL BLOW OUT THE LEDS IN THE SCREEN <br>
      -GND = Ground Pin <br>
      -SCE = Pin 7  - Chip select <br>
      -RST = Pin 6  - Reset <br>
      -D/C = Pin 5  -Data/Command <br>
      -DN = Pin 11 - Serial data <br>
      -SCLK = Pin 13  - Serial clock <br>
      -LED = 9    - Backlight LED</p>

<p>~ JoyStick Shield Hookup <br>
      This shield provides very easy hookup. The shield simply connects straight into the ardunio board. It also has direct <br> connection for the Nokia 5110 screen, however it is slightly skewed to the side.</p>

<p>~ Bluetooth Hookup <br>
      BHurl currently researching, will also update soon!</p>

<p>Installation Instructions:</p>

<p>~Libaries Required: <br>
      Currently the only library planned is for the Tic-Tac-Toe game which is currently being built. </p>
